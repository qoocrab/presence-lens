## 📋 Access Timeline

We are currently undergoing IRB and institutional review due to inclusion of participant behavioral data and third-party VR content. A sanitized, license-compliant version of the dataset will be released publicly upon completion of this review.

## 🛡️ Ethical and Legal Considerations

- All participants provided informed consent under IRB protocol.
- Raw video and audio recordings contain identifiable behavior and will not be publicly released.
- VR application content is subject to copyright by third-party developers and cannot be redistributed. Instead, we will release derived feature representations that preserve analysis while complying with license restrictions.
